## Measurements of orthogonal aptamers

To find aptamers orthogonal with the Spinach aptamer we created the 5 aptamers from the article by Paige, et. al, 2011 along with their respective fluorophores. The first step of the orthogonality experiments was to find an aptamer that had around the right fluorescence enhancement. Therefore we tested the fluorophores on their own with their correct fluorophore, at the wavelengths best suited for them. Their individual fluorescent enhancement are shown in figure xx, along with the experimentally decided fluorescence enhancement of Spinach. 

[Figure xx, graph of all the aptamers enhancements]

As seen in figure XX, the fluorescence enhancement was virtually non-existing for most of the aptamer-fluorophore complexes, except for the 17-3 & DMHBI complex, which showed an increase in fluorescence when compared to DMHBI alone. It was not quite as profound as Spinach & DFHBI, so when Mango arrived we wanted to try this as well. Something more, when TOF-3 is done maybe?
