##Measurements of orthogonal aptamers

To find aptamers orthogonal with the Spinach aptamer we created the 5 aptamers from the article by Paige et. al, 2011 along with their respective fluorophores (See [Supplementary](supplementary.html) ). The first step of the orthogonality experiments was to find an aptamer that had a fluorescence enhancement of the same magnitude as Spinach. Therefore we tested the fluorophores on their own with their correct fluorophore, at their optimum excitation wavelengths according to the article. Their individual fluorescent enhancement are shown in figure xx, along with the experimentally decided fluorescence enhancement of Spinach.

As seen in figure 1, the fluorescence enhancement was virtually non-existing for most of the aptamer-fluorophore complexes. The only exception is the 17-3 & DMHBI complex, which showed an increase in fluorescence when compared to DMHBI alone; however it was not as profound as Spinach & DFHBI. 
Upon synthesis of Mango and its fluorophore TO3, the complex was tested for fluorescence. It showed a fluorescence of 9x the fluorescence of TO3 alone at 659 nm (Figure 2A), which is in the right order of magnitude as Spinach, which in this experiment showed an increase of 37x the fluorescence of DFHBI at 497 nm (Figure 2B). 
Orthogonality tests were designed to test the fluorescence of the two aptamers with their own and the other fluorophore at excitation wavelengths corresponding to excitation of Mango-TO3 (610 nm) and Spinach-DFHBI (497 nm), respectively. The best possible outcome would be an excitation of Spinach-DFHBI at 497 nm and an excitation of Mango-TO3 at 610 nm, and no fluorescence with all other combinations. The results show that the only significant fluorescent enhancement are the complexes with the correct fluorophore and the correct excitation wavelength (Figure 2A & B), but a small enhancement is seen for Spinach with TO3 with excitation at 460 nm. At the maximum emission wavelength for Spinach-DFHBI (497 nm) the enhancement is 4x the fluorescence of TO3 alone. The orthogonality is still intact however, as this fluorescence enhancement does not happen with the Spinach-SAM complex T1, even when adding enough SAM to reach the usual maximum fluorescence with DFHBI (Figure 3). At this point, the fluorescence enhancement is 1,03x for T1-TO3, compared to an enhancement of 3,4x for T1-DFHBI as you will see in (Finding the Kdvalue)[kddata.html] . 

Based on these data in can be concluded that Mango will be able to serve as an internal control for our sensor.
