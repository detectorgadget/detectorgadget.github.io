## DFHBI synthesis

3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (3)47To a round-bottomed flask 2,6-difluorophenol (1.50 g, 11.5 mmol) and hexamethylenetetramine (1.60 g, 11.5 mol) in TFA (10 mL) was added. The mixture heated at reflux under argon overnight. The solution was then cooled to room temperature and the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The crude residue was mixed with DCM and washed with NaHCO~3~. The aqueous layers were acidified to pH 1 with concentrated HCl. The solutionwas then extracted with DCM, dried over MgSO~4~ and the solvent was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The product was passed through a silica plug, washed with pentane and then vacuum dried. The product was obtained as a white solid (1.17 g, 64%). Rf 0.38 (1:2 EtOAc/pentane). mp (uncorr.) 119.7-122.4 °C. ^1^H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl~3~) δ~H~ (ppm) 9.82 (t, 1H), 7.5 (m, 2H), 5.85 (s, 1H). ^13^C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ~C~ (ppm) 189.2, 152.0 (dd, *J*=256 Hz and 6 Hz), 139.0 (t, *J*=16 Hz), 128.3 (t, *J*=6 Hz), 113.5 (dd, *J*=15 Hz and 7 Hz). ^19^F NMR (377 MHz, CDCl~3~) δ~F~ (ppm) -132.9. HRMS (ESI) *m/z* [M+H]+ calc. for C7H5O2F2 159.0252, found 159.0247.
4-acetate-3,5-difluorobenzylidene oxazolone (4)30To a round-bottomed flask 3 (0.1998 g, 1.26 mmol), N-acetylglycine (0.1497 g, 1.28 mmol), NaOAc (0.1037 g, 1.26 mmol) and acetic anhydride (1.0 mL) were added. The mixture stirred at 110 °C for 2.5 h and was then cooled to room temperature. Cold EtOH (4 mL) was added and the reaction cooled at 4 °C overnight. The resulting solid was washed with cold EtOH, pentane and it wasthen vacuum dried. The product was obtained as a yellow solid (0.2764 g, 78%). Rf 0.57 (100% DCM). mp (uncorr.) 145.5-147.0 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δH (ppm) 7.75 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 2H), 6.96 (s, 1H), 2.43 (s, 3H), 2.39 (s, 3H); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): δC (ppm) 167.8, 167.2, 167.1, 155.2 (dd, J=250 Hz and 47 Hz), 134.6, 131.9 (t, J=9 Hz), 129.1 (t, J=17 Hz), 127.7 (t, J=3 Hz), 115.6 (dd, J=18 Hz and 6 Hz), 20.4, 16.1. 19F NMR (377 MHz, CDCl3) δF (ppm) -124.9. HRMS (ESI) m/z [M+H]+ calc. for C13H10NO4F2 282.0572, found 282.0569.
3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxy benzylidene imidazolinone (1)5A solution of 4 (0.030 g, 0.107 mmol) in EtOH (4.0 mL) was mixed with K2CO3 (0.023 g, 0.160 mmol) and CH3NH2 (0.05 mL). The mixture heated at reflux for 3 h. Upon cooling a precipitate formed, which was filtered and extracted with EtOAc and NaOAc (500 mM pH 3.0). The organic layers were separated, dried over MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuo. The compound was purified by flashchromatography (6:1 EtOAc/pentane with 1% formic acid). The product was obtained as a yellow solid (0.0135 g, 50%). Rf = 0.30 (6:1 EtOAc/pentane with 1% formic acid). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD3OD): δH (ppm) 7.77 (dd, J=8 Hz and 1.6 Hz, 2H), 6.91 (s, 1H), 3.19 (s, 3H), 2.44 (s, 3H), missing OH proton due to deuterium exchange; 19F NMR (377 MHz, CD3OD) δF (ppm) -136.4. HRMS (ESI) m/z [M+H]+ calc. for C12H11F2N2O2F2 253.0783, found 253.0782. It was not possible to obtain a 13C NMR spectrum since the sample could not get concentrated enough.
