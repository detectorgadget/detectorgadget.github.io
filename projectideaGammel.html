<h1>The project idea</h1>

When deciding the topic of our project, it was important for the team to use cutting edge research that could be applied in a new way. When we heard about the optical RNA aptamer called Spinach and the many useful applications of it and other aptamers, we almost instantly decided that we wanted to be a part of the fast evolving field of aptamer biology. An aptamer is an oligonucleic acid or a peptide molecule that bind to a target with affinities and specificities that rival those of antibodies. Optical aptamers are capable of inducing fluorescence upon binding to their target molecule. An example of this is the RNA aptamer called Spinach, which fluoresce at a wavelength of 495 nm upon binding to 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI). The part of the Spinach aptamer research that appealed the most to us was combining the Spinach aptamer with another aptamer to make a biosensor.

<p>Our concentration dependent biosensor system is based on the aptamer system that Paige et. al. described in 2012. The main issue with this otherwise innovative sensor (See [The original construct](theoriginalconstruct.html) ), is that it is only capable of detecting whether or not the target molecule is present in a reasonable amount - and not the concentration of it. Therefore our ultimate goal was to improve this sensor by making it concentration dependent. We wanted to do this by making RNA sensors with different affinities for the same target molecule, which can be combined to improve the dynamic range of the sensor. We also wanted to improve the accuracy of the signal *in vivo* by combining the sensor with an internal control; an orthogonal optical aptamer, which would fluoresce independently of the target molecule concentration. The orthogonal aptamer will ensure a baseline to compare the fluorescent signal from the sensor.</p>

<h1> The original construct</h1>

One of the many qualities of aptamers is that they selectively binds to almost any desired target. When an aptamer binds a molecule, it can induce structural changes of the molecule which can lead to fluorescence that is only apparent when the aptamer binds the fluorophore - this is called an optical aptamer, and is for obvious reasons perfect for a sensor. An example of this is the RNA aptamer called Spinach (discovered by Paige, et. al. in 2011, enhanced by Strack, et. al. in 2013), which fluoresces only when bound to DFHBI. It has an fluorescent enhancement that rivals that of green fluorescent protein and almost no photobleaching. Knowing the great possibilities of binding different targets with RNA aptamers, the next step is combining Spinach with detecting aptamers, thereby creating an RNA-based non-photobleaching sensor.<br>
Though most sensors based on aptamers currently only detect a few model molecules like S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Thrombin, they are possible to modify to target almost any desired metabolite, molecule, organism etc. This introduces the possibility of measuring targets that have been difficult to measure so far.

<p>Paige et. al. found in 2012 that combining the Spinach aptamer with a SAM detecting aptamer as seen in figure XX, made detection of SAM by fluorescence experiments possible. They even showed that the system still worked when using a different target detecting aptamer, showing the great flexibility of the system.</p>

Figure 1: The original SAM sensor as described by Paige et. al in 2012. The sensor RNA consists of the optical aptamer Spinach (black), a linker region (orange) and a detection aptamer (blue). When the aptamer binds its target, stabilization of the linker region is promoted, enabling Spinach to fold and activate DFHBI fluorescence. Picture retrieved from [4]. 


<p>The detection aptamer is attached to Spinach through a linker region, which will be able to fold correctly and allow fluorescence only if the specific target is present. When the target is not present, the detection aptamer, and thereby the linker region, is unstable, and the system will not fluoresce significantly. There will always be some fluorescence from spontaneous interactions between the fluorophore and optical aptamer but this is negligible. When the detection aptamer binds its target and folds correctly, the linker region stabilizes the structure of the optical aptamer, Spinach, enabling the binding with DFHBI and the fluorescence. The linker region thus acts as a bridge between the optical aptamer and the detection aptamer and therefore does not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or target).</p>

<p>There are a few problems with this otherwise innovative and versatile sensor. One is that it is only capable of detecting whether or not the target is available - but not the concentration of it. Therefore, part of this project will focus on attempting to make the sensor concentration dependent by making point mutations in the construct. Another point of focus in the project is the expression of this sensor *in vivo*, and how the fluorescence may depend as much upon the transcriptional level of RNA as on the concentration of SAM. A fluorescent aptamer will been sought after, which will aid with a baseline fluorescence with which to compare the fluorescence of the sensor. It will be incorporated in the RNA construct to assure that the transcriptional level of the aptamers are the same.</p>

<section id="Concentrationdependence">

<h1> Concentration Dependence</h1>

The most important aspect of our project is to show that it is possible to create aptamers with varying binding affinities for a target metabolite, thereby leading to different detection ranges.

<p>To obtain this result, ten different constructs were designed with mutations in their linker region or recognition aptamer (See [The original construct](theoriginalconstruct.html)), which was supposed to give the constructs different affinities for SAM.
Four constructs were made with mutations in the linker region (T constructs) and six constructs were made with mutations in the aptamer recognizing SAM (SM constructs). Two different linker regions were used for the two different mutations classes, as the most effective linker region (According to Paige et. al) was just 1 GC base pair, which was not suitable for the T constructs. The second most effective linker region was 2 GC base pairs, and this was instead used for the T constructs.
The wild type linker region consists of two GC-basepairs, as seen in construct T1. The idea behind the mutations was to lower the stability of this stem, therefore one of the GC-pairs were exchanged with an AU-basepair (T2 and T3) or an AC-mismatch-pair (T4). The different mutations can be seen in the figure below.</p>

<p>The wild type SAM detecting aptamer is seen in figure 1A as construct SM1. In the constructs SM2 and SM3, one base in the metabolite recognition loop is mutated, which was expected to affect the affinity for the binding of the SAM metabolite. 
In the SM4 and SM5 constructs, one base in the second loop is mutated, which was expected to affect the stability of the tertiary structure of the aptamer-SAM metabolite complex.<br>
In the SM6 construct, two GC-basepairs are switched, which was expected to affect the folding of the aptamer. 
The different constructs can be seen below.</p>

<h1>Broad dynamic range</h1>

The dynamic range is the area in which the sensor is able to detect a concentration change. The range depends on the binding affinity between the sensor and the target that it should detect, called the dissociation constant or the K<sub>d</sub>-value. To broaden the dynamic range of the sensor, constructs with different K<sub>d</sub>-values will be combined - see [The final construct](thefinalconstruct.html). Figure 3 shows the theory behind combining sensors with different K<sub>d</sub>-values to broaden the dynamic range.<br>
The K<sub>d</sub>-value is found experimentally by making numerous measurements with varying target concentrations. The data are plotted in a graph of fluorescence intensity versus target concentration and the K<sub>d</sub>-value is found as the target concentration corresponding to half of the maximum fluorescence.

Figure 4: Concept description of broadening the dynamic range by combining two aptamer with different detection ranges. If one construct is able to detect the target molecule in for example the blue range, while another construct is able to detect the target molecule in the green range, combining the two constructs broadens the dynamic range of the biosensor, and enables detection of the target molecule in the full red range.

<section id="Internalcontrol">
<h1>Finding a suitable internal control</h1>


Another aspect of the project is to find another RNA aptamer for internal control, which is orthogonal to the Spinach-DFHBI complex. The internal control and the Spinach constructs need to be orthogonal in two ways. The maximum emission wavelengths must be different from one another, and the RNA aptamers should not be capable of binding each others fluorophores. Furthermore, the fluorescent enhancement of the aptamers should be in the same order of magnitude.

<p>The aptamer-fluorophore complexes from the article by Paige et. al., 2011 all have maximum emission wavelengths at different places. These aptamers were recreated, the fluorophores were synthesized and the complexes were tested for fluorescent enhancement at the fluorometer, Fluoro-Max-3. In August 2014 the Mango aptamer and its thiazol orange derivative fluorophore, TO3, were discovered and published by Dolgosheina et. al. These were also synthesized for orthogonality testing. The Mango-TO3-complex  is expected to have a fluorescence enhancement in the same order of magnitude as Spinach, which will make this aptamer-complex suitable for an internal control. The maximum fluorescence is expected to be at 660 nm, which is well away from the maximum fluorescence of Spinach at 497 nm.<br>
Experiments will be conducted to test if the Spinach aptamer can bind the Mango fluorophore or if the Mango aptamer can bind the DFHBI. If they don't bind to the fluorophore of each other, the fluorescence signal will be specific and that will make Mango suitable for being the internal control in the sensor system.</p>

<section id="Invivo">

<h1>In vivo experiments</h1>

A vital part of the experiment is to test whether the constructs can be expressed and still work *in vivo*. One of the reasons it is difficult to express RNA *in vivo* is that the cells have RNases that will degrade the RNA to protect itself against foreign RNA. This creates a problem when designing RNA constructs for use *in vivo*. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the tRNA scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites as seen in figure 1.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/theproject/invivo.png" class="img-responsive img-center">
Figure 6: The tRNA scaffold is marked inside the box. The scaffold include the acceptor stem, the D-loop and the TΨC-loop, but not the anticodon. The anticodon is replaced with the desired RNA insert (Picture from [5]). 


<p>To get the constructs inside the cells, we pack them into DNA plasmids that are transformed into the cells with electroporation. Once inside the cell, the constructs can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery to get transcribed and processed as natural E. Coli tRNA, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. Another consequence of the tRNA scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids versions with different and wrong lengths, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the  tRNA scaffold, the RNA is still functional and accumulate steadily inside the cell.</p>

<section id="Thefinalconstruct">

<h1> The final construct</h1>

The final goal of our project was to combine two or more improved aptamer sensors, thereby broadening the dynamic range of the original sensor and adding an internal control. 

<p>The improved constructs named T1 and T2 (See [Concentration dependence](concdependence.html)) show promise for broadening the dynamic range, which will be discussed under [Finding the K<sub>d</sub> values](kddata.html). Therefore these two were selected to be combined in the final construct, named Salad. <br>
A big problem about using fluorescent biosensors, is that they are expressed inside the cells, and cell expression can vary. This will make the data unreliable, as having less fluorescence in a cell might not be an indication for a lower concentration of the target, but rather the cells lower expression of the constructs. The composition of the two aptamers into the same construct ensures that the expression level of both aptamers are the same. Furthermore an internal control have been added to the Salad-construct. This control is the Mango aptamer, which is a high affinity RNA aptamer that binds to thiazole orange derivatives. The fluorescence of Mango does not depend on the concentration of the target, and it can therefore serve as a baseline to normalize the fluorescence. <br>
Inside the cells, cellular RNases are a problem since they can degrade Salad. A tRNA scaffold therefore surrounds the total construct which helps disguise it as described under [in vivo]. </p>

<p>With this construct, it will be possible to measure the concentration of a target inside cells via the T1 and T2 sensors with a broadened dynamic range. The data is made reliable by the internal control, and the construct itself is protected by a tRNA-scaffold which will make them functional inside the cells. The Salad construct could therefore be a very useful concentration-measuring construct, when the concentration of small molecules in vivo is needed. </p>
