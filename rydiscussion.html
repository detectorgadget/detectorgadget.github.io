<h1>Conclusion</h1>
As seen in figure XX, we have reached almost all of our goals. We have succeeded in making mutations in the linker region of the SAM sensor to change the K<sub>d</sub> value of the complex, thus broadening the dynamic range of the sensor. We have found an aptamer-fluorophore complex, which is orthogonal to the Spinach-DFHBI complex and thus can be used as an internal control for the full construct. The full construct has been designed; however, the time did not allow synthesizing and testing it.

<h1>Outlook</h1>
Future experiments would start out with synthesizing and testing the construct for fluorescence and dependence upon SAM both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We would also like to make further mutations on the SAM sensor to achieve greater difference in K<sub>d</sub> values, thus broadening the dynamic range even more. Further experiments would include changing the detection aptamer to have affinity for other targets and aspiring to make interchanging detecting aptamers as easy as possible. It could also be interesting to attempt to use Mango as the optical aptamer of the sensor instead of the internal control, to utilize the high affinity for its fluorophore.
