<h1>Conclusion and Outlook</h1>
During the BIOMOD project new sensor constructs were designed and tested. We found that mutations of the Spinach-SAM linker region were able to modulate the K<sub>d</sub> value of the complex. Two such constructs were identified. By combining these a sensor with a broadened dynamic range was achieved. Furthermore the Mango aptamer-fluorophore complex was found to be orthogonal to the Spinach-DFHBI complex making it a viable internal standard for monitoring the transcription level. A full construct consisting of the two sensor complexes and the internal control was designed but not assembled. <i>In vivo</i> validation of the unmodified Spinach-SAM sensor was performed creating a platform for testing the new sensor complexes. <br>
Future experiments will focus on producing and analyzing the full construct both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Creating new SAM-sensors to increase the span in K<sub>d</sub> values is of major interest as this broadens the dynamic range further. 
We imagine that expanding the system to enable simultaneous detection of several species <i>in vivo</i> would be highly relevant. This could be achieved by fusing the Mango aptamer with a small molecule detecting aptamer and using it in conjunction with a Spinach sensor.

<h1>Goals reached</h1>
All of the subgoals were reached during our project, however, construction and testing of the final construct was not performed due to time limitatios. A schematic of the achievements is presented below.
