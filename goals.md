##Goals

The ultimate goal was to create a sensor which combined two or more sensors with different K~d~'s for the target with an internal control. To attain this goal, many sub-goals were set up.


* Master assembly PCR & PCR

* Transcription of RNA aptamers


* Reproduce Spinach & Mango article results


* Design mutations in SAM-Spinach aptamer

* Test the mutations

* Find the K_d 

* Test constructs in vivo


* Find aptamers possibly orthogonal to Spinach

* Synthesis of fluorophores for orthogonal aptamers

* Test of orthogonality of Spinach & Mango & other aptamers


* Design total construct (Salad construct)

* Test of total construct

* Save the world
