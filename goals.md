##Goals


The ultimate goal was to create a sensor which combined two or more sensors with different dissociation coefficients for the target with an internal control. To attain this goal, many sub-goals were set up.



* Use and perfect assembly PCR & PCR for the DNA constructs


* Transcribe the RNA aptamers


* Verify the results from PCR and transcription with gel electrophoresis

*

* Reproduce results concerning optical aptamers found in the articles by Paige, et. al. (2011) and Dolgosheina, et. al. (2014).

*

* Design mutations in the spinach-based SAM detecting sensor from the article by Paige, et. al. (2012). 


* Test the mutated constructs for fluorescence with different concentrations of SAM


* Find the dissociation constants for the functional constructs


* Test sensor constructs *in vivo* 

*

* Search the literature for aptamers orthogonal to Spinach


* Design and synthesize orthogonal aptamers


* Synthesize the small organic compounds to be used as fluorophores for orthogonal aptamers and Spinach.


* Test the orthogonality of Spinach & other aptamers

*

* Design the total construct (Salad construct)


* Test the total construct for fluorescence of Mango, and the dependence of Spinach fluorescence of SAM
