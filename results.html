<h1>Development of concentration dependent sensors</h1>

In this section the construction and evaluation of Spinach-SAM sensors with modified concentration dependence is presented. Combining several constructs with significant differences in kD is expected to broaden the dynamic range of the full construct. This is illustrated below.

<h2>Design</h2>
The basis of our study is the original Paige construct (REF) in which the Spinach aptamer is linked to a SAM aptamer through a linker. We hypothesized that changing the linker region between the aptamers or introducing mutations in the SAM aptamer  would influence the concentration dependency of the biosensor.  
 
Four constructs were created with mutations in the linker region (T constructs) and six constructs were created with mutations in the aptamer recognizing SAM region (S constructs). Two different linker regions were used for the two different classes. The most effective linker (REF Paige et. al) was just one GC base pair and is used in the S constructs. The second most effective linker region was 2 base pairs; a GC and a CG bp. This region was mutated for the T constructs. The purpose of the mutations was to lower the stability of stem and affect the concentration dependency. Hence one of the GC pairs was exchanged with an AU base pair (construct T2 and T3) or an AC mismatch (construct T4). The different mutations are shown in the Figure 2. Furthermore, the figure shows the mutations in the S constructs. The wild type SAM detecting aptamer is called S1. In the construct S2 and S3 one base in the metabolite recognition loop was mutated. This was expected to affect the affinity for the binding of the SAM metabolite. In the S4 and S5 constructs, one base in the second loop was mutated. This was expected to affect the stability of the tertiary structure of the aptamer-SAM metabolite complex. In the S6 construct two GC-basepairs were switched, which was expected to affect the folding of the aptamer.</p>

<h2>Assembly PCR and transcription</h2>

Due to the lenght of the RNA aptamers, smaller DNA fragments were purschased and assembled into the full lenght DNA counterpart. This was done by assembly PCR and is illustrated in the Figure 3.a. The DNA was then amplified by PCR. In the DNA sequence a T7 promotor was included. This was used for transcription of the DNA into the RNA aptamers.

<h2>Measurement of K<sub>d</sub> values</h2>

The mutated RNA constructs were tested for effect by a series of measurements of the fluorescence of 

<ul>
	<li>DFHBI</li>
	<li>DFHBI & RNA</li>
	<li>DFHBI, RNA & SAM</li>
</ul>

<p>The final concentrations of SAM in the first trial was 100x, 1,000x and 10,000x the concentration of RNA, which was held at 0.26 µM. This was tried on our 10 constructs, which gave the results seen in figure 1.</p>

The last measurement is a control with no added RNA. </div>
</div>

<p>The only 2 constructs responding to DFHBI and SAM are T1 and T2. T1 is the original sensor from Paige, et. al. 2013, except for a few improvements on the optical sensor, and T2 is a mutated form of T1 with an AT-basepair instead of a GC-basepair in the linker region. These two were selected for further testing, where the K<sub>d</sub> value was determined by more sensitive addition of SAM. This lead to the graphs in figure 2, which show an average over 3 series of measurements on each construct.</p>

</div>

<p>To determine the K<sub>d</sub> value, the measurements were fitted with a second degree polynomium. The K<sub>d</sub> value was found as the concentration of SAM that lead to fluorescence at half of the maximum fluorescence - that is, the x value corresponding to the half of the maximum y value. The K<sub>d</sub> values were 302 µM and 218 µM for T1 and T2 respectively. The mutation in T2 made its linker region less stable than than that of T1, and correspondingly more dependent on the target molecule. Counterintuitively, the less stable construct needed the least amount of target molecule to stabilize the optical aptamer for fluorescence - and it stabilized the structure better to reach a higher final fluorescence.<br>
 The two structures were mixed 1:1 to a total concentration of RNA of 0,26µM and the measurements were carried out again. As seen in figure 3, the total fluorescence was less than for the individual measurements of the constructs. It is possible that this problem could be helped by fusing the two together, as we have done in the detector gadget construct. <br>
The apparent K<sub>d</sub> value was calculated to be 235 µM, which shows that it was possible to move the apparent K<sub>d</sub> value to a value between the original two. The apparent K<sub>d</sub> was more affected by the T2 construct. This was a result of the higher fluorescence in T2.  </p>

</div>

<p>We have shown that the mutations in T2's linker region makes the sensor more sensitive to the target concentration with a total fluorescence higher than that of the original sensor. We have also shown that by combining the two constructs, it is possible to change the apparent K<sub>d</sub> value of the total construct. </p>

<h1> Finding orthogonal optical aptamers</h1>

Another aspect of the project is to find an orthogonal optical RNA aptamer, which should function as an internal control for the level of transcription.
The aptamer should be orthogonal to the Spinach-SAM-DFHBI complex. This includes the following characteristics: 
1. The excitation wavelengths of the orthogonal aptamers must not overlap
2. The emission and excitation wavelenght between the orthogonal pair must not overlap 
3. The optical RNA aptamers should not display unspecific binding to non-target ligands 

<h2>Synthesis of fluorophores and aptamers</h2>

</div>

<p> The five fluorophores, DFHBI, 2-HBI, DMHBI and DMABI from the article by Paige et. al, 2011 (See [Supplementary](supplementary.html) ) were synthesized. In addition two new fluorophore analogues were proposed and synthesized. It was anticipated that these would display a bathochromic fluorescence shift due to the extended pi network of the NI fluorophore and the NBI having a nitro-group with a hydroxyl-group acting as an auxochrome . 

The corresponding aptamers(REF) were produced by assembly PCR, amplified by PCR and transcribed into RNA. The gels showing succesfull amplification are shown below.

<h2>Evaluation of fluorophore-aptamer pairs</h2>

The fluorescense enhancement of the fluorophore upon aptamer binding was initially evaluated (Figure 10). As shown in the graph only Spinach and Mango display a significant fluorescence enhancement of 37 and 9 respectively.

</div>

</p>
An experiment was setup to test the orthogonality of Mango, Spinach, and their respective fluorophores. The two constructs are excited at 610 nm for Mango-TO3 and 460 nm for Spinach-DFHBI. 
The results show that the only significant fluorescence enhancement is achieved for the complexes with the correct fluorophore at the correct excitation wavelength (Figure 11). A small enhancement is seen for Spinach with TO3 with excitation at 460 nm. At the maximum emission wavelength for Spinach-DFHBI (497 nm) the enhancement is 4x the fluorescence of TO3 alone. 
The orthogonality is still preserved, as there is no fluorescence enhancement for the T1 Spinach-SAM complex. When adding SAM to reach the usual maximum fluorescence the fluorescence enhancement is just 1.03x for T1-TO3. This is shown in Figure 12.</p>

<p>Based on these data in can be concluded that Mango will be able to serve as an internal control for our sensor. </p>

<h1> In vivo setup </h1>


<p>The aim was to test the concentration dependent constructs <i>in vivo</i>. The previously published results for in vivo fluorescence of Spinach was reproduced, however our final constructs remain to be tested.</p>

<h2>Design and considerations</h2>
RNA is difficult to express <i>in vivo</i> as cells have RNases that will degrade it as a protection mechanism for RNA. This is important for the design of RNA constructs for <i>in vivo</i> usage. The RNA can be protected from RNases utilizing tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in the tRNA is replaced by the desired RNA insert via restrictions sites as seen in figure 1.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/theproject/invivo.png" width="60%" class="img-responsive img-center">
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 figure-text">Figure 13: The tRNA scaffold is marked inside the box. The scaffold include the acceptor stem, the D-loop and the TΨC-loop, but not the anticodon. The anticodon is replaced with the desired RNA insert (Picture from [REF]). </div>
</div>


<p>To achieve transcription of the RNA inside cells, the DNA template was packed in DNA plasmids that were transformed into E. coli cells by electroporation. Once inside the cell, the constructs can take advantage of the host cell's transcription and processing machinery. The tRNA scaffold furthermore ensures transcription of the correct lenght of RNA, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed <i>in vivo</i>.</p> 

A plasmid containing the original Spinach-SAM construct was kindly provided by the Jaffrey lab, at Cornell University. 
To include a positive control for the experiments a plasmid containing only Spinach was produced. The DNA fragment containing restriction sites was made by assembly PCR using an ultramer (an ultramer is up to 200 bps) and two shorter oligonucleotider. This is shown in Figure 14.

</div>

The DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and cloned into the plasmid. After transformation into E. coli and cultering the plasmid DNA was isolated and the successfull incorporation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing.

<h2>Confocal fluoroscence microscopy</h2>

Three different constructs were tested in E. coli; Spinach, Spinach-SAM and an untransformed control. SAM in endogenously present in the cell. It can be artificially supplemented by adding methionine to the media. The results are shown in Figure 16 and Figure 17. As expected only a small amount of fluorescense was observed for the negative control containing no inserts. The positive Spinach control showed a high level of fluorescence, which was 2.7 times larger than the negative control. When adding methionine, despite our expectations the fluorescence fell. The Spinach-SAM construct in the pressence of DFHBI showed an increase in fluorescence of 1.42. When adding additional methionine the fluorescent signal again fell. In the <i>in vitro</i> experiments it was observed that SAM concentrations above a certain treshold had a quenching effect on the fluorescence. It was hypothesized that the reduction in fluorescence might be the result of the same effect.</p>
