## Concentration dependence

The most important aspect of our project is to show that it is possible to create aptamers with varying affinity for a target metabolite, thereby leading to a concentration dependent aptamer. The two parts of the full sensor which utilizes this are called the transducer module and recognition module. 
The recognition module is attached to the transducer module and will, when the specific metabolite is present, be able to fold correctly. When the metabolite is not present, the recognition module, and thereby the entire complex, is unstable, and the system will not fluoresce significantly. There will always be some fluorescence from the fluorophore and fluorescence module reacting with each other spontaneously, but this is a miniscule fraction of the full fluorescence.
The function of the transducer module is, when the recognition module is folded correctly, to stabilize the structure of the optical aptamer so that it can react with the fluorophore and fluoresce. The transducer module thus acts as a bridge between the fluorescence module and the recognition module and will therefore not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or metabolite).
