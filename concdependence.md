## Concentration dependence

The most important aspect of our project is to show that it is possible to create aptamers with varying binding affinity for a target metabolite, thereby leading to different detection ranges. 
To obtain this result, ten different constructs were designed with mutations in their linker region or recognition aptamer (See [theoriginalconstruct.html]), which was supposed to give the constructs different affinities for SAM.Four constructs were made with mutations in the linker region and six constructs were made with mutations in the aptamer recognizing SAM.The wild type linker region consists of two GC-basepairs, as seen in construct T1. The idea behind the mutations was to lower the stability of this stem, therefore one of the GC-pairs were exchanged with an AT-basepair (T2 and T3) or an AC-mismatch-pair (T4). The different mutations can be seen in the figure below.

In the constructs SM2 and SM3, one base in the metabolite recognition loop is mutated, affecting the affinity for the binding of the SAM metabolite. (Er ikke sikker på vi må konkludere dette? Det virkede jo ikke)In the SM4 and SM5 constructs, one base in the second loop is mutated, affecting the stability of the tertiary structure of the aptamer-SAM metabolite complex. (ligeledes med dette)In the SM6 construct, two GC-basepairs are switched, affecting the folding of the aptamer. (Og her)The different constructs can be seen below.

###Broad dynamic range

The dynamic range is the area in which the sensor is able to detect a concentration change. This area depends on the binding affinity between the sensor and the metabolite that it should detect, the K_d_-value. To broaden the dynamic range of the sensor, constructs with different K_d_-values will be combined - see [thefinalconstruct.html].The K_d_-value is found experimentally by making numerous measurements with varying metabolite concentrations. The data are than plotted in a graph, fluorescence intensity versus metabolite concentration and the Kd-value is found as the point where the slope of the graph is highest.
