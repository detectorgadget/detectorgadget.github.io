## Concentration dependence

The most important aspect of our project is to show that it is possible to create aptamers with varying binding affinities for a target metabolite, thereby leading to different detection ranges. 

To obtain this result, ten different constructs were designed with mutations in their linker region or recognition aptamer (See [The original construct](theoriginalconstruct.html)), which was supposed to give the constructs different affinities for SAM.
Four constructs were made with mutations in the linker region and six constructs were made with mutations in the aptamer recognizing SAM.
The wild type linker region consists of two GC-basepairs, as seen in construct T1. The idea behind the mutations was to lower the stability of this stem, therefore one of the GC-pairs were exchanged with an AT-basepair (T2 and T3) or an AC-mismatch-pair (T4). The different mutations can be seen in the figure below.

The wild type SAM detecting aptamer is seen in figure 1A as construct SM1. In the constructs SM2 and SM3, one base in the metabolite recognition loop is mutated, which was expected to affect the affinity for the binding of the SAM metabolite. 
In the SM4 and SM5 constructs, one base in the second loop is mutated, which was expected to affect the stability of the tertiary structure of the aptamer-SAM metabolite complex.
In the SM6 construct, two GC-basepairs are switched, which was expected to affect the folding of the aptamer. 
The different constructs can be seen below.

###Broad dynamic range

The dynamic range is the area in which the sensor is able to detect a concentration change. The range depends on the binding affinity between the sensor and the target that it should detect, called the dissociation constant or the K~d~-value. To broaden the dynamic range of the sensor, constructs with different K~d~-values will be combined - see [The final construct](thefinalconstruct.html). Figure 3 shows the theory behind combining sensors with different K~d~-values. 
The K~d~-value is found experimentally by making numerous measurements with varying target concentrations. The data are than plotted in a graph, fluorescence intensity versus target concentration and the K~d~-value is found as the target concentration corresponding to half of the maximum fluorescence.
