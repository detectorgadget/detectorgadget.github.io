## Orthogonality

The fluorescence module is that part of the sensor that comprises an optical aptamer; An aptamer that can bind a small fluorophore, thereby inducing fluorescence. The concentration dependence is visualized by utilizing three different optical aptamers, which emits fluorescence at different wavelengths. Ideally, the fluorophores should be entirely orthogonal so they do not have any overlaps in their emission spectra, which makes interpretation of the emission much easier. The fluorophores need also be orthogonal in a different sense of the word; they should not emit unwanted fluorescence with each others fluorophores. Ideally, they would all bind the same fluorophore, but emit light at different wavelengths, but since the field of optical aptamers is still young, it is not possible to find three such aptamers with suitable 

# The fluorescence module
Paige et. al [YY] used an optical aptamer called Spinach (more about this aptamer below), as the fluorescence aptamer. This aptamer is called Spinach because it binds to the fluorophore DFHBI and emits light at around 498 nm and therefore appear green as Spinach in fluorescence experiments.
