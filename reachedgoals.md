##Goals reached



* Use and perfect assembly PCR & PCR for the DNA constructs


* Transcribe the RNA aptamers


* Verify the results from PCR and transcription with gel electrophoresis



* Reproduce results concerning optical aptamers found in the articles by Paige, et. al. (2011) and Dolgosheina, et. al. (2014). 



* Design mutations in the spinach-based SAM detecting sensor from the article by Paige, et. al. (2012). 


* Test the mutated constructs for fluorescence with different concentrations of SAM


* Find the dissociation constants for the functional constructs


* Test constructs in vivo (Skal ‚àö¬∂ndres til hvilken type af konstrukter der rent faktisk er kommet ind i cellen)



* Search the literature for aptamers orthogonal to Spinach


* Design and synthesize orthogonal aptamers


* Synthesize the small organic compounds to be used as fluorophores for orthogonal aptamers and Spinach.


* Test the orthogonality of Spinach & other aptamers



* Design the total construct (Salad construct)


* Test the total construct for fluorescence of Mango, and the dependence of Spinach fluorescence of SAM


* Save the world with Salad (Trine: Denne her skal ikke med, skal den? :P)


We have reached almost all of our goals.

Something to work on in the future:

Making random point mutations to test more possibilities. Some more.
