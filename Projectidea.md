## Project idea

When deciding the topic of our project, it was important for the team to use cutting edge research that could be applied to some problem in a new way. When we heard about the optical RNA aptamer called Spinach and the many useful applications of it and other aptamers, we almost instantly decided that we wanted to be a part of the fast evolving field of aptamer biology. The part of the research around the Spinach aptamer that appealed the most to us was combining the Spinach aptamer with other aptamers, because of the vast possibilities with aptamer detection, and generally using the Spinach aptamer as a reporter in sensors.

Our concentration dependent biosensor system is based on the aptamer system that Paige et. al. described in 2012 [YY]. The main issue with this otherwise innovative sensor (See [The original construct](theoriginalconstruct.html) ), is that it is only capable of detecting whether or not a metabolite is present in a reasonable amount - not the concentration of it. Therefore our ultimate goal was to improve this sensor by making it concentration dependent. We wanted to do this by making metabolite recognizing aptamers with different affinities for the same target, which can be combined to improve the dynamic range of the sensor. We also wanted to improve the accuracy of the signal by combining the sensor with an internal control; an orthogonal optical aptamer, which would fluoresce independent of the SAM concentration, so there would always be a baseline fluorescence to compare the output with.
