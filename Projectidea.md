## Project idea

When deciding the topic of the joint project, it was important for the team to use cutting edge research that could be applied to some problem in a new way. When we heard about the optical aptamer called Spinach and the many useful applications of it and other aptamers, we almost instantly decided that we wanted to be a part of the fast evolving field of aptamer biology. The part of the research around the Spinach aptamer that appealed the most to us was combining the Spinach aptamer with other aptamers, because of the vast possibilities with aptamer detection, and generally using the Spinach aptamer as a reporter in sensors.

One of the many qualities of aptamers is the fact that an aptamer can be found, that selectively binds to almost anything. Though to this day most sensors based on aptamers only detect model molecules like SAM, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Thrombin, it is possible to make aptamer sensors for molecules that are currently difficult to detect otherwise.

Our concentration dependent biosensor system is based on the aptamer system that Paige et. al. described in 2012 [YY]. Here they found that by combining a fluorescence aptamer with a metabolite recognizing aptamer as seen in figure XX, they could detect a specific metabolite by fluorescence experiments. They even showed that the system still worked when using a different metabolite recognizing aptamer, showing the great flexibility of the system.

The main issue with this otherwise innovative sensor, is that it is only capable of detecting whether or not a metabolite is present in a reasonable amount - not the concentration of it. Therefore our goal was to improve this sensor by making it concentration dependent. We wanted to do this by making metabolite recognizing aptamers with different affinities for the same target, which can be combined to deduce a broad dynamic range.
