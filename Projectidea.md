## Project idea

Our concentration dependent biosensor system is based on the aptamer system that Paige et. al. described in 2012 [YY]. Here they found that by combining a fluorescence aptamer with a metabolite recognizing aptamer as seen in figure XX, they could detect a specific metabolite by fluorescence experiments. They even showed that the system still worked when using a different metabolite recognizing aptamer, showing the great flexibility of the system.

The main issue with this otherwise innovative sensor, is that it is only capable of detecting whether or not a metabolite is present in a reasonable amount - not the concentration of it. Therefore our goal was to improve this sensor by making it concentration dependent. We wanted to do this by making metabolite recognizing aptamers with different affinities for the same target, which can be combined to deduce a broad dynamic range.
