##Finding a suitable internal control


Another aspect of the project was to find an internal control, which fluoresced at a different wavelength than the Spinach-DFHBI complex. The aptamers from the article by Paige et. al., 2011 were recreated, the fluorophores were synthesized and the complexes were tested at the fluorometer, Fluoro-Max-3. As you will see in [Measurements of orthogonal aptamers](orthogonaldata.html) the fluorescence enhancement is not as high as needed, so when the Mango aptamer and fluorophore TO3 were discovered by Dolgosheina et. al. in August 2014 it was synthesized as fast as possible. The Mango-TO3-complex is expected to have a fluorescence enhancement in the same order of magnitude as Spinach, which will make this aptamer-complex more suitable for an internal control compared with the previously tried aptamer-complexes. The maximum fluorescence is shown to be measured at 660 nm, which is well away from the maximum fluorescence of Spinach at 497 nm. 


###Orthogonality
The internal control and the Spinach constructs need to be orthogonal in two ways. The emission wavelengths must be different from one another, and the RNA aptamers should not be capable of binding each others fluorophores. Therefore, experiments were conducted to test if the Spinach aptamer can bind the Mango fluorophore or if the Mango aptamer can bind the DFHBI. If they donâ€™t bind to the fluorophore of each other, the fluorescence signal will be specific and that will make Mango suitable for being the internal control in the sensor system.
