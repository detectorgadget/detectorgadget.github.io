## In vivo experiments

A vital part of the experiment is to test whether the constructs can be expressed and still work *in vivo*. One of the reasons it is difficult to express RNA *in vivo* is that the cells have RNases that will degrade the RNA to protect itself against foreign RNA. This creates a problem when designing RNA constructs for use *in vivo*. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the tRNA scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites as seen in figure 1.

To get the constructs inside the cells, we pack them into DNA plasmids that are transformed into the cells with electroporation. Once inside the cell, the constructs can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery to get transcribed and processed as natural E. Coli tRNA, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. Another consequence of the tRNA scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids versions with different and wrong lengths, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the  tRNA scaffold, the RNA is still functional and accumulate steadily inside the cell.
