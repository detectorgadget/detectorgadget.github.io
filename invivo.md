## In vivo experiments


A vital part of the experiment was to test whether the constructs could be expressed and would still work *in vivo*. To protect itself against foreign RNA, the cells have RNases that will degrade the RNA. This creates a problem when design RNA constructs for use *in vivo*. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites (figure).

(Figur fra word)

To get the constructs inside the cells, we pack them into DNA plasmids that are transformed into the cells with electroporation. Once inside the cell, the constructs can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery to get transcribed and processed as natural E. Coli tRNA, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. Another consequence of the scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids the heterogeneity, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the scaffold, the RNA is still functional inside the cell and accumulate stably inside them as well. 

Maria skriver (Christina, det kan vÊre at jeg lige skal vÊre der nÂr du gennemgÂr de her rettelser - og ogsÂ Leandro):
"... could be expressed in the cell and also would still work in vivo" - jeg er ikke sikker pÂ hvad forskellen er? - rettet
"..., the cell have RNases that will degrade the RNA." - rettet
"... when designing RNA constructs..." - "*in vivo*" ? In vivo skal stÂ med skrÂskrift? rettet
"To protect the RNA tRNA scaffolds is used as camouflage."
"... replaced in the scaffold with the RNA construct insert via..." der skal mÂske vÊre mere prÊcise henvisninger til hvor pÂ figuren at disse restriktions sites er
"..., we wrap them in DNA plasmids."
"The cells is transformed..." - "... the plasmid by electroporation,..." - hvorfor skal det med, det med heatshock? - rettet
"... take advantage of the host cell's cell machinery..."
"the RNA has a defined length and avoids heterogeneity," - forstÂr jeg ikke.
"... inside the cell and accumulate steadily."
GENERELT: 
Kan vi mÂske sige tRNA scaffold hver gang, da man (jeg) ellers bliver forvirret i hvilket scaffold? - det samme for RNA --> RNA construct?
Datid eller nutid? Konsistent omkring det!
