## In vivo experiments

To protect itself against foreign RNA, the cells have RNases that will degrade it. This creates a problem when design RNA constructs for use in vivo. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffold as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites (figure).

(Figur fra word)

Disguised as natural RNA inside the E. coli cell, it can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. This happens because the cellular enzymes recognize it as tRNA and process the primary transcript and even goes so far as to incorporate modified nucleotides.  Another consequence of the scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids the heterogeneity, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the scaffold, the RNA is still functional inside the cell and accumulate stably inside them as well.
