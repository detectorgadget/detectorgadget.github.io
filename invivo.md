## In vivo experiments

A vital part of the experiment was to test whether the constructs could be expressed in the cells and would still work *in vivo*. To protect itself against foreign RNA, the cells have RNases that will degrade it. This creates a problem when design RNA constructs for use in vivo. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites (figure).

(Figur fra word)

Disguised as natural RNA inside the E. coli cell, it can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. This happens because the cellular enzymes recognize it as tRNA and process the primary transcript and even goes so far as to incorporate modified nucleotides.  Another consequence of the scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids the heterogeneity, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the scaffold, the RNA is still functional inside the cell and accumulate stably inside them as well. 

S책 okay, jeg gav op p책 at skrive mere - jeg ved ikke nok om det. :) Hvordan f책r vi dem ind i cellen? Er det RNA constructs der fyres ind i cellen eller er det plasmider, eller en anden form for DNA? Der st책r bare at vi udnytter cellens celle maskineri, men jeg ved ikke hvad det indbefatter?
