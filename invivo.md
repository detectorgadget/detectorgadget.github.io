## In vivo experiments

A vital part of the experiment was to test whether the constructs could be expressed in the cells and would still work *in vivo*. To protect itself against foreign RNA, the cells have RNases that will degrade it. This creates a problem when design RNA constructs for use in vivo. Protecting the RNA is achievable by the use of tRNA scaffolds as camouflage.  The anticodon stem in tRNA is replaced in the scaffold by the RNA insert via restrictions sites (figure).

(Figur fra word)

To get the constructs inside the cells, we pack them into DNA plasmids. The cells get transformed with the plasmid with electroporation, but the cheaper alternative heatshock could also be used. Once inside the cell, the constructs can take advantage of the host cells cell machinery to get transcribed and processed as natural E. Coli tRNA, and therefore evades the cellular RNase. Another consequence of the scaffold is procession; the RNA has a defined length and avoids the heterogeneity, which usually is a problem with recombinant RNA expressed in vivo. While being surrounded by the scaffold, the RNA is still functional inside the cell and accumulate stably inside them as well.
