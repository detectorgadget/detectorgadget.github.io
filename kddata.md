## Measurements of K~d~

To discover which of our RNA constructs that could be a possibility for our sensor, we took a series of measurements of the fluorescence of 
* DFHBI, 
* DFHBI & RNA 
* DFHBI, RNA & SAM
The final concentrations of SAM was in the first trial 10x, 100x and 10.000x the concentration of RNA, which was held at 0,26 µM. This was tried on our 10 constructs, which gave the results seen in figure xx.

The only 2 constructs showing true promise are the two named T1 and T2. T1 is the original sensor from Paige, et. al. 2013, except for a few improvements on the optical sensor part, and T2 is a mutation with an AT-basepair instead of a GC-basepair in the linker region. These two were selected for further testing, where the K~d~ value would be determined, by adding smaller amounts of SAM in between each measurements. This lead to the graphs in figure xx.

To determine the K~d~ value, the points were fitted with a degree 3 polynomial. The K~d~ value is determined as the point on the polynomial where the slope is steepest, which must be 

hmm.. Er det ikke halvvejs midt i mellem to vendepunkter? Men det har vi jo ikke her - der siger vi halvvejs mellem et toppunkt og et tilfældigt punkt på grafen?
