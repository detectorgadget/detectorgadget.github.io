## Measurements of K~d~

The mutated RNA constructs were tested for effect by a series of measurements of the fluorescence of 

* DFHBI

* DFHBI & RNA 

* DFHBI, RNA & SAM

The final concentrations of SAM in the first trial was 10x, 100x and 10.000x the concentration of RNA, which was held at 0,26 µM. This was tried on our 10 constructs, which gave the results seen in figure 1.

The only 2 constructs responding to DFHBI and SAM are T1 and T2. T1 is the original sensor from Paige, et. al. 2013, except for a few improvements on the optical sensor, and T2 is a mutated form of T1 with an AT-basepair instead of a GC-basepair in the linker region. These two were selected for further testing, where the K~d~ value was determined by more sensitive addition of SAM. This lead to the graphs in figure 2, which is an average over 3 series of measurements on each construct.

To determine the K~d~ value, the measurements were fitted with a degree 3 polynomial. The K~d~ value is found as the concentration of SAM corresponding that leads to half of the maximum fluorescence - that is, the x value corresponding to the half of the maximum y value. The K~d~ values were 302 µM and 218 µM for T1 and T2 respectively. The mutation in T2 made its linker region less stable than T1s, and correspondingly more dependent on the target molecule. Counterintuitively, the less stable construct needs the least amount of target molecule to stabilize the optical aptamer for fluorescence - and it stabilizes the structure better to reach a higher final fluorescence.
The two structures were mixed to a final concentration equal to the one in the previous experiment and the measurements were carried out again. As seen in figure 3, the total fluorescence was less than for the individual measurements of the constructs, which might mean something?? It is possible that this problem could be helped by fusing the two together, as we have done in the detector gadget construct. 
The apparent K~d~ value was calculated to 235 µM, which shows that we succeeded in moving the apparent K~d~ value to a value between the original two. It is more affected by the T2 construct, as it is not the average of the two values, which is a result of the higher fluorescence in T2.

We have shown that the mutations in T2's linker region makes the sensor more sensitive to the target concentration with a total fluorescence higher than that of the original sensor. We have also shown that by combining the two constructs, we can change the apparent K~d~ value of the total construct.
