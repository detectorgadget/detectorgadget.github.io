##The final construct


By combining two concentration measuring aptamers, it is possible to broaden the dynamic range, thereby increasing the possible detection range of a ligand. T1 and T2 are both biosensor aptamers for the SAM ligand with different kD values. These aptamers are made by mutation the existing Spinach-SAM aptamer to give different affinities. They are both fluorescent when bound to the ligand and the fluorophore DFHBI. Combining both aptamers in one construct, named Salad, will therefore increase the dynamic range but also insure that the expression level between both aptamers are the same. The big problem with using these fluorescent biosensors, is that they are expressed inside the cells, and cell expression can vary. This will make the data uncertain, so that having less fluorescence in a cell might not be an indication for the concentration of the ligand, but rather the cells expression of the constructs. To combat this issue an internal control have been added to the Salad-construct. This control is the Mango aptamer, which is a high affinity RNA aptamer that binds to thiazole orange derivatives. The fluorescent of Mango does not depend on the concentration of ligand, and is therefore great candidate for an internal control to normalize the fluorescence. Inside the cells, cellular RNases is problems since they can degrade Salad. A tRNA scaffold therefore surrounds the construct. This protects it by hijacking the host cells cell machinery, since it is disguised as natural RNA. The RNA is still functional inside the cell and accumulate stably inside them as well. With this construct, it is possible to measure concentration of a ligand inside the cells via the T1 and T2 aptamers with a broad dynamic range. This data is reliable because of the internal control. And the construvt itself is protected by a tRNA-scaffold which will make them functional inside the cells. The Salad is there for a very useful concentration-measuring construct, when the concentration of small molecules in vivo are needed.
