<h1>Background</h1>

<p> Cellular processes are highly dependent on metabolite concentrations and even small perturbations can lead to cell differentiation, apoptosis or cancer. <sup>1</sup> A biosensor system that allows determination of metabolite concentrations <i>in vivo</i> is therefore a valuable tool.  </p>

<p> An aptamer is an nucleic acid or a peptide molecule that binds to a target with affinities and specificities that rival those of antibodies. Optical aptamers are capable of inducing fluorescence in a target molecule upon binding. An example of this is the RNA aptamer called Spinach (discovered by Paige, et. al. in 2011, enhanced by Strack, et. al. in 2013).<sup>2,3</sup> This aptamer binds the molecule 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI) (see animation) and causes it to fluoresce at a wavelength of 495 nm. It has an fluorescent enhancement that rivals that of green fluorescent protein and has almost no photobleaching.</p>

<p>In 2012 Paige et. al. found that fusing the Spinach aptamer with an s-adenosyl methionine (SAM) aptamer (as seen in Figure 2) made detection of SAM possible. They furthermore showed that other small-molecule aptamers work in the system showing its great flexibility.<sup>4</sup></p>

The sensor RNA consists of the optical aptamer Spinach (black), a linker region (orange) and a detection aptamer (blue). When the aptamer binds its target, stabilization of the linker region is promoted, enabling Spinach to bind DFHBI and activate fluorescence. Picture retrieved from [4]. </div>

<h1>The Project Idea</h1>

<p> The goal of the project was to develop a sensor that can detect small molecules in a broad range of concentrations and could give a reliable signal <i>in vivo</i>. To obtain a sensor with a broad dynamic range we wanted to construct RNA sensors with different affinities for the same target molecule. These can be combined to improve the dynamic range of the sensor. We furthermore wanted to include a internal control for the level of transcription, as this can vary from cell to cell and result in an inaccurate readout. We therefore need an orthogonal optical aptamer, which would fluoresce independently of the target molecule concentration. To build this system we chose to use the Spinach-SAM aptamer system described by Paige et. al.<sup>4</sup>
</p>

<p>We aim to achieve this by designing different small molecule sensors with different stabilities towards the target molecule and furthermore investigate the orthogonality.</p>

The construct consists of two modified Spinach-SAM concentration dependent complexes fused to an orthogonal optical aptamer that functions as internal standard for RNA transcription level. When subjected to low concentrations of SAM only one of the two complexes will fold correctly and induce fluorescence. As the concentration of SAM increases the second complex will also fold correctly and induce fluorescence.

<h1>Goals</h1>

The overall goal of the project was to create a concentration dependent biosensor. The biosensor should consist of multiple small molecule dependent aptamers with different affinities for the target creating a broader dynamic range. To ensure a reliable readout in a cellular setting the sensor must contain an internal control for the transcription level.
In order to achieve this the following subgoals had to be reached:
1. Design and test aptamer sensors with different concentration dependency
2. Evaluate fluorophore-aptamer pairs to create an orthogonal internal control for the transcription level
3. Setup an evaluation platform for testing the biosensor <i>in vivo</i>   

We devised the following workflow:
