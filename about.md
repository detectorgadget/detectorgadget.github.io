## About the team

The team entering the biomolecular design competition BIOMOD 2014 from Aarhus University comprises 6 students from nanoscience, organic chemistry and molecular biology. We are all contributing to the full project with our own bachelor project and have worked both individually and cooperatively on the experiments described.
