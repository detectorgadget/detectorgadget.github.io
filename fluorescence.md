## Fluorescence measurements

All fluorescence measurements were made on the FluoroMax-3 (Inc 1 s, slit length 5 nm (Orthogonality tests) or 10 nm (SAM sensor construct), integration time 0,05 s, 37°C). 
Measurements were made with the following excitation wavelength and emission range:
Spinach + DFHBI:Excitation 460 nm, emission range 480 to 600 nm. 
Mango + TOF3: Excitation 610 nm, emission range 620 to 800 nm. 
17-3 / 2-4 / 3-6 + DMHBI: Excitation 400 nm, emission range 410 to 600 nm. 
11-3 + DMABI: Excitation 480 nm, emission range 500 to 600 nm. 
6-8 + 2-HBI: Excitation 400 nm, emission range 500 to 600 nm. 

DFHBI, DMHBI, 2-HBI, DMABI and TOF-3 was solvated in a selection buffer with 40 mM HEPES, 125 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl~2~ and 2 µM fluorophore. RNA was added for a final concentration of 0,26 µM.
