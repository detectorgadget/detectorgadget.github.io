## Fluorescence measurements

All fluorescence measurements were made on the FluoroMax-3. Measurements with Spinach and DFHBI were made with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm and an emission detection range from 480 to 600 nm. 
The concentration of DFHBI was 10x the concentration of RNA. DFHBI, DMHBI and TOF-3 was solvated in a selection buffer with 40 mM HEPES, 125 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl~2~ and 10 ÂµM fluorophore.
