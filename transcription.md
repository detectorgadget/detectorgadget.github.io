## Transcription

The transcription mixture consisted of 5μL 10x Transcription Buffer, 5μL 10mM DTT, 20μL DNA template, 15μL 10 mM NTP mix, 4μL H2O, 1μL T7 RNA polymerase (1μg/μL), giving a total volume of 50μL. The mixture was added to a PCR tube and heated at 37°C for 4 hours.

###8% & 12% POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL
An 8% polyacrylamide gel consists of 29mL Urea concentrate, 5mL TBE(10x), 16mL Urea diluent, 0,5mL APS and 16μL TEMED, giving a total volume of 50mL. These were used for purifying the RNA with subsequent ethanol precipitation and were loaded with 100 µL RNA per well.
A 12% polyacrylamide gel consists of 19mL Urea concentrate, 4mL TBE(10x), 17mL Urea diluent, 0,4mL APS and 16μL TEMED, giving a total volume of 40mL. These were used for quality controlling the RNA without purification and were loaded with 5 µL RNA per well.

The gel was prerun at 600V for 15 minutes before loading RNA samples with RNA loading buffer (0,6mL of 0,5M EDTA, 700 μL of a mixture of formamide, xylencyanol and bromophenol blue supplied by H. C. Høiberg and 13,7 mL formamide). It was mixed 1:1 with RNA samples. 


###PRECIPITATION
Ethanol precipitation was used to extract RNA from the 8% polyacrylamide gel. The bands were cut out and left overnight in 300μL extraction buffer (0,3M NaAc, 0,25mM EDTA) on a shaker at 4°C. The next day the samples were centrifuged at 17.000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 750 μL 96% ethanol.  After vortexing, the samples were put on dry ice (-80°C) for 15 minutes and centrifuged again at 17.000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and 100-200 μL 70% ethanol was added, and centrifuged at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was again discarded and the pellets were dried under a fumehood and solvated in 50 μL water.
For measuring the concentrations of the purified RNA transcripts, the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer was used.
