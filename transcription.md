## Transcription

The transcription mixture consisted of 5ŒºL 10x Transcription Buffer, 5ŒºL 10mM DTT, 20ŒºL DNA template, 15ŒºL 10 mM NTP mix, 4ŒºL H2O, 1ŒºL T7 RNA polymerase (1Œºg/ŒºL), giving a total volume of 50ŒºL. The mixture was added to a PCR tube and heated at 37¬∞C for 4 hours.

###8% & 12% POLYACRYLAMIDE GEL
An 8% polyacrylamide gel consists of 29mL Urea concentrate, 5mL TBE(10x), 16mL Urea diluent, 0,5mL APS and 16ŒºL TEMED, giving a total volume of 50mL. These were used for purifying the RNA with subsequent ethanol precipitation and were loaded with 100 ¬µL RNA per well.
A 12% polyacrylamide gel consists of 19mL Urea concentrate, 4mL TBE(10x), 17mL Urea diluent, 0,4mL APS and 16ŒºL TEMED, giving a total volume of 40mL. These were used for quality controlling the RNA without purification and were loaded with 5 ¬µL RNA per well.

The gel was prerun at 600V for 15 minutes before loading RNA samples with RNA loading buffer (0,6mL of 0,5M EDTA, 700 ŒºL of a mixture of formamide, xylencyanol and bromophenol blue supplied by H. C. H√∏iberg and 13,7 mL formamide). It was mixed 1:1 with RNA samples.

###PRECIPITATION
Ethanol precipitation was used to extract RNA from the 8% polyacrylamide gel. The bands were cut out and left overnight in 300ŒºL extraction buffer (0,3M NaAc, 0,25mM EDTA) on a shaker at 4¬∞C. The next day the samples were centrifuged at 17.000 rpm at room temperature for 15 minutes, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 750 ŒºL 96% ethanol.  After vortexing, the samples were put on dry ice (-80¬∞C) for 15 minutes and centrifuged again at 17.000 rpm at 4¬∞C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and 100-200 ŒºL 70% ethanol was added, and centrifuged at 4¬∞C for 15 minutes. The supernatant was again discarded and the pellets were dried under a fumehood and solvated in 50 ŒºL water.
For measuring the concentrations of the purified RNA transcripts, the NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer was used.

* TÊnker at det ikke er vigtigt at nÊvne at vi prerunner den. Det synes jeg aldrig man g¯r i artikler 
** Skal vi nÊvne at vi har fÂet RNA loading buffer fra H.C? Det er sÂdan en lille ting vi har fÂet fra ham?
