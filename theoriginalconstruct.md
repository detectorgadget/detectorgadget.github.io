##The original construct

One of the many qualities of aptamers is the fact that an aptamer can be found, that selectively binds to almost anything. When an aptamer binds a molecule, it can even induce a change in the molecule which can lead to fluorescence that is only apparent when the aptamer binds the fluorophore - this is called an optical aptamer, and this is for obvious reasons perfect for a sensor. Though to this day most sensors based on aptamers only detect model molecules like S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Thrombin, it is possible to make aptamer sensors for molecules that are currently difficult to detect otherwise.

Paige et. al. found in 2012 that by combining a fluorescent aptamer (Spinach) with a metabolite recognizing aptamer as seen in figure XX, they could detect a specific metabolite by fluorescence experiments. They even showed that the system still worked when using a different metabolite recognizing aptamer, showing the great flexibility of the system.

The recognition aptamer is attached to the fluorescent aptamer by the linker region, which   will be able to fold correctly and allow fluorescence only if the specific metabolite is present. When the metabolite is not present, the recognition aptamer, and thereby the entire complex, is unstable, and the system will not fluoresce significantly. There will always be some fluorescence from the fluorophore and fluorescing aptamer reacting with each other spontaneously, but this is a miniscule fraction of the full fluorescence.
The function of the linker region is, when the recognition aptamer is folded correctly, to stabilize the structure of the optical aptamer (Spinach) so that it can react with the fluorophore (DFHBI) and fluoresce. The linker region thus acts as a bridge between the fluorescence aptamer and the recognition aptamer and therefore does not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or metabolite).
