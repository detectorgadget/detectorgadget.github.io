##The original construct

The recognition aptamer is attached to the linker region and will, if the specific metabolite is present, be able to fold correctly. When the metabolite is not present, the recognition aptamer, and thereby the entire complex, is unstable, and the system will not fluoresce significantly. There will always be some fluorescence from the fluorophore and fluorescing aptamer reacting with each other spontaneously, but this is a miniscule fraction of the full fluorescence.
The function of the linker region is, when the recognition aptamer is folded correctly, to stabilize the structure of the optical aptamer so that it can react with the fluorophore and fluoresce. The linker region thus acts as a bridge between the fluorescence aptamer and the recognition aptamer and will therefore not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or metabolite).
