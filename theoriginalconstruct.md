##The original construct

One of the many qualities of aptamers is that it selectively binds to almost any desired target. When an aptamer binds a molecule, it can induce a change in the molecule which can lead to fluorescence that is only apparent when the aptamer binds the fluorophore - this is called an optical aptamer, and is for obvious reasons perfect for a sensor. 
Though most sensors based on aptamers only detect few molecules like S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Thrombin, they are very easy to modify to target almost any desired metabolite, molecule, organism etc. and is today of great interest for measuring targets that has been difficult to measure so far.

Paige et. al. found in 2012 that when combining a fluorescent aptamer (Spinach) with a metabolite detecting aptamer as seen in figure XX, they could detect a specific metabolite by fluorescence experiments. They even showed that the system still worked when using a different metabolite detecting aptamer, showing the great flexibility of the system.

The detection aptamer is attached to the fluorescent aptamer by the linker region, which   will be able to fold correctly and allow fluorescence only if the specific metabolite is present. When the metabolite is not present, the detection aptamer, and thereby the entire complex, is unstable, and the system will not fluoresce significantly. There will always be some fluorescence from spontaneous interactions between the fluorophore and fluorescing aptamer but this is negligible.

When the detection aptamer is folded correctly, the linker region stabilizes the structure of the optical aptamer (Spinach) so that it can react with the fluorophore (DFHBI) and fluoresce. The linker region thus acts as a bridge between the fluorescence aptamer and the recognition aptamer and therefore does not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or metabolite).
