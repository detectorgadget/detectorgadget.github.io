## Concentration dependence

The transducer moduleThe function of the transducer module is, when the metabolite module is folded cor- rectly, to stabilize the structure of the Spinach aptamer so that it can react with the fluorophore and fluoresce. Like this the transducer module will act as a bridge between the fluorescence module and the recognition module and will therefore not interact directly with either of the molecules (fluorophore or metabolite).The recognition moduleThe recognition module is attached to the transducer module and will, when the specific metabolite is present, be able to fold correctly (which will enable the trans- ducer module to fold correctly and so on). When the metabolite is not present, the recognition module is not able to fold correctly, and the system will not fluoresce sig- nificantly (there will always be some fluorescence from the fluorophore and Spinach module reacting with each other spontaneously).
