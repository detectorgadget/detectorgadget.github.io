<h1> Small Molecule Detection - Engineering Spinach Based Biosensors </h1>

<p>Since the discovery of Green Fluorescent Protein, it has revolutionized 
fluorescent imaging of biomolecules inside cells and animal tissue. A similar 
fluorescent signal can be obtained with the RNA aptamer Spinach, which also 
allows direct optical monitoring of RNA <i>in vivo</i>. The qualitative detection of a 
small molecule is enabled by fusing Spinach with a small molecule aptamer, 
however, quantitative detection has never been achieved.<br>
Here we show the construction of a modified biosensor system for concentration 
dependent detection of the metabolite S-adenosylmethionine, SAM. By adjusting 
the stability of the linker region of the Spinach-SAM construct, the aptamer 
folding is made dependent on the concentration of the metabolite. An orthogonal 
aptamer-fluorophore pair termed Mango-TO3 serves as an internal control of RNA transcription levels. 
Combining several concentration dependent constructs allows us to construct a biosensor 
with a broadened dynamic range.</p>
